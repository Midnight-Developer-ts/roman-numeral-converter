# Roman Numeral Converter

This project is part of my FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification.
It is a web-based application that converts numbers between Arabic numerals (e.g., 1, 2, 3) and Roman numerals (e.g., I, II, III).

The project was created to practice JavaScript algorithms, conditional logic, and string manipulation, while also reinforcing my HTML and CSS skills for building the interface.
