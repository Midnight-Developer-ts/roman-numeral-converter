# 🔢 Midnight Developers Roman Numeral Converter

## 📖 Overview
This project was part of my FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification curriculum. Where I built a Roman Numeral Converter using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project was created to practice JavaScript algorithms, conditional logic, and string manipulation, while also reinforcing my HTML and CSS skills for building the interface. 

The Roman Numeral Converter allows users to input a number and see its equivalent Roman numeral representation, and vice versa. It is a web-based application that converts numbers between Arabic numerals (e.g., 1, 2, 3) and Roman numerals (e.g., I, II, III). It was a great exercise in DOM manipulation and implementing conversion algorithms.

## ✨ Features
- Convert Arabic numbers (1–3999) into Roman numerals.
- Input validation to prevent invalid numbers.
- Simple, user-friendly design with HTML and CSS.
- Interactive functionality powered by JavaScript.

## 🛠️ Built With
- HTML – structure
- CSS – styling
- JavaScript – logic and interactivity

## 🚀 How to Use
